                                <strong>Give your sales a boost when you advertise financing。</strong><br/>PayPal helps turn browsers into buyers with financing
                                from PayPal Credit&#174;。 Your customers have more time to pay, while you get paid up front – at no additional cost to you。
                                Use PayPal’s free banner ads that let you advertise PayPal Credit&#174; financing as a payment option when your customers check out with PayPal。
                                The PayPal Advertising Program has been shown to generate additional purchases as well as increase consumer's average purchase sizes by 15%
